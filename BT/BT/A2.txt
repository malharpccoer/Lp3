1. Basic Knowledge of Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency is a digital asset that serves as a medium of exchange using cryptographic methods to secure transactions, control the creation of new units, and verify asset transfers. Key points include:

Decentralized Nature: Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks powered by blockchain technology.
Blockchain Technology: A distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers, ensuring transparency and security.
Popular Cryptocurrencies:
Bitcoin (BTC): The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, introduced by an anonymous person or group under the name Satoshi Nakamoto.
Ethereum (ETH): Known for supporting smart contracts and decentralized applications.
Security Features: Cryptography ensures the integrity and security of transactions.
Wallets and Keys:
Public Key: Similar to an account number, used to receive funds.
Private Key: Secret key used to sign transactions and access funds.
Mining and Consensus Mechanisms:
Mining: The process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain, often rewarded with new coins.
Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS): Common consensus mechanisms to secure the network and validate transactions.
2. Basic Knowledge of Distributed Computing Concept
Distributed computing involves multiple computer systems working together to solve a common problem or perform a shared task. Key concepts include:

Definition: A computing paradigm where processing power, data, or services are distributed across multiple nodes in a network.
Nodes: Individual computers or servers that contribute to the distributed system.
Parallel Processing: Tasks are divided and processed concurrently by different nodes, enhancing efficiency and reducing processing time.
Scalability: Distributed systems can scale horizontally by adding more nodes, which improves capacity and performance.
Fault Tolerance: Systems remain operational even if some nodes fail, increasing reliability.
Examples:
Distributed Databases like MongoDB and Cassandra.
Frameworks: Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark for handling big data.
Applications: Used in cloud computing, data processing, scientific simulations, and cryptocurrency networks.
3. Working of Blockchain
Blockchain is the technology that powers cryptocurrencies and many other decentralized systems. It functions as an immutable, distributed ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent manner. Here's how it works:

Structure:
Block: Each block contains a batch of transactions, a timestamp, a cryptographic hash of the previous block, and a unique identifier (hash).
Chain: Blocks are linked sequentially, forming a continuous chain where each block references the previous one.
Core Concepts:
Decentralization: The blockchain ledger is maintained across a network of nodes, preventing central control.
Consensus Mechanism: A method for validating new blocks and achieving agreement on the state of the blockchain:
Proof of Work (PoW): Nodes solve complex mathematical problems to add a new block (used in Bitcoin).
Proof of Stake (PoS): Validators are chosen to create new blocks based on their stake in the network (used in Ethereum 2.0).
Transaction Process:
Initiation: A user requests a transaction, which is broadcast to the network.
Verification: Nodes validate the transaction using cryptographic methods.
Block Formation: Validated transactions are bundled into a new block.
Consensus and Addition: The new block is added to the chain through consensus.
Immutability: Altering a block retroactively requires changing all subsequent blocks, making tampering practically impossible.
Applications:
Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others rely on blockchain for transaction records.
Smart Contracts: Self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code.
Supply Chain: Enhances transparency and traceability.
