Here is a detailed overview of each topic to help you in your practical exam:

### 1. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
An Artificial Neural Network is a computational model inspired by the human brain's structure. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), where:

- **Input Layer**: Receives the initial data.
- **Hidden Layers**: Perform complex computations and feature extraction. Each neuron applies weights, biases, and an activation function to transform the input data.
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction or classification.

**How ANNs Work**:
- **Forward Propagation**: Data moves from the input layer through hidden layers to the output layer, undergoing transformations.
- **Activation Functions**: Functions like ReLU, sigmoid, or softmax introduce non-linearity to the model.
- **Backpropagation**: A training algorithm that adjusts weights using a gradient descent method to minimize the loss function and improve model accuracy.

ANNs are highly versatile and can be used for tasks such as classification, regression, and more.

### 2. **Keras**
Keras is an open-source deep learning library written in Python that provides a user-friendly interface for building neural networks. It acts as an abstraction layer over backends like TensorFlow and Theano.

**Key Features**:
- **Simplicity and Ease of Use**: Allows quick prototyping and development of deep learning models.
- **High-Level API**: Simplifies building complex models with minimal code.
- **Modular Design**: Models can be built by stacking layers and configuring them with different parameters.
- **Model Types**:
  - **Sequential Model**: A linear stack of layers, suitable for simple architectures.
  - **Functional API**: Allows building more complex models with non-linear structures.

**Example of a Simple Model**:
```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### 3. **TensorFlow**
TensorFlow is an open-source framework developed by Google for numerical computation and building machine learning models, especially deep learning. It provides:

- **Graph Computation**: Uses data flow graphs where nodes represent mathematical operations, and edges represent tensors (data arrays).
- **Scalability**: Efficiently runs on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, supporting distributed computing.
- **TensorFlow Core**: Low-level operations for custom model building.
- **High-Level APIs**: Keras is integrated within TensorFlow as `tf.keras`, simplifying deep learning model development.

**Tensor Operations**: TensorFlow uses tensors (multi-dimensional arrays) to perform operations like matrix multiplication, element-wise addition, and more.

### 4. **Normalization**
Normalization is a data preprocessing step that scales data features to a common range, usually [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. This is crucial for models that are sensitive to feature scaling, such as neural networks.

**Why Normalize?**:
- **Improves Convergence Speed**: Helps in faster and more stable training by preventing large gradients.
- **Avoids Bias**: Ensures no single feature dominates due to its scale.

**Common Methods**:
- **Min-Max Scaling**:
  \[
  X_{norm} = \frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}
  \]
- **Z-score Normalization** (Standardization):
  \[
  X_{standard} = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
  \]
  where \( \mu \) is the mean and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation.

### 5. **Confusion Matrix**
A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It summarizes the actual vs. predicted classifications and helps compute key metrics:

|                | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Actual Positive** | True Positive (TP)       | False Negative (FN)      |
| **Actual Negative** | False Positive (FP)      | True Negative (TN)       |

**Key Metrics Derived**:
- **Accuracy**: \(\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}\)
- **Precision**: \(\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\) (measures the accuracy of positive predictions)
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: \(\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\) (measures the modelâ€™s ability to identify actual positives)
- **F1 Score**: \(2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}\) (harmonic mean of precision and recall)

The confusion matrix provides a clear picture of where a model makes errors and helps in fine-tuning and improving performance.
