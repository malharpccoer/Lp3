1. Basic Knowledge of Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. Key aspects to be familiar with include:

Data Types: int, float, str, list, tuple, set, dict.
Control Structures: if, else, elif for conditional logic, and for and while loops for iteration.
Functions: Defined using def keyword, allowing reusable code blocks.

Copy code
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
Libraries: Essential for data science and machine learning:
NumPy for numerical operations.
Pandas for data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.
Syntax and Indentation: Python uses indentation to define code blocks, ensuring readability.
File Handling: Basic operations like reading from and writing to files using open(), read(), write(), and close().
2. Concept of Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix is a table that describes the performance of a classification model on a set of test data where the true values are known. It helps visualize the accuracy of a classifier by showing the counts of predicted versus actual class labels.

Predicted Positive	Predicted Negative
Actual Positive	True Positive (TP)	False Negative (FN)
Actual Negative	False Positive (FP)	True Negative (TN)

3. Concept of ROC-AUC Curve
The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a graphical representation that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier as its discrimination threshold varies.

AUC (Area Under the Curve):

The AUC score quantifies the overall ability of the model to distinguish between classes.
An AUC of 0.5 indicates no discriminative power (random guessing), while an AUC of 1.0 represents perfect classification.
Usage: The ROC-AUC is used to compare models and choose the one with a better trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

4. Concept of Random Forest and KNN Algorithms
Random Forest:

Definition: An ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions, combining their outputs for a final result.
How it Works:
Builds multiple decision trees using different random subsets of the dataset.
Each tree votes, and the majority class (classification) or average (regression) is selected.
Advantages:
Handles overfitting better than individual decision trees.
Works well with both categorical and continuous data.
Hyperparameters: Number of trees (n_estimators), maximum depth, and minimum samples per leaf.
K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN):

Definition: A simple, non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression.
Working Mechanism:
Finds the k nearest data points to a query point using a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean).
The majority class among the neighbors determines the classification.
Key Considerations:
Choosing 
𝑘
k: Smaller 
𝑘
k values can lead to noise sensitivity (overfitting), while larger values may cause underfitting.
Distance Metrics: Common ones include Euclidean and Manhattan distances.
Advantages: Easy to implement and interpret.
Disadvantages: Computationally intensive for large datasets, sensitive to the scale of features (requires normalization).
