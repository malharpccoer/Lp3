1. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial initial step in data analysis and machine learning pipelines that prepares raw data for modeling. Key steps include:

Data Cleaning: Identifies and corrects issues such as missing or inconsistent data. Methods include filling missing values (imputation) with mean, median, or mode, or removing incomplete rows.
Data Transformation: Converts data into an appropriate format. This may involve normalization (scaling data between 0 and 1) or standardization (scaling data to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1), which helps algorithms converge faster and perform better.
Encoding Categorical Data: Converts non-numeric data into numerical formats using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
Feature Scaling: Ensures that features are on a similar scale to improve algorithm performance.
Feature Selection: Selects the most relevant features to reduce the dataset's dimensionality and enhance model performance.
2. Binary Classification
Binary classification is a type of classification task that involves categorizing data into one of two classes, often labeled as 0 and 1 (e.g., spam vs. not spam). Common aspects include:

Algorithms: Many algorithms can perform binary classification, such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and decision trees.
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances.
Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions, useful for minimizing false positives.
Recall (Sensitivity): The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives, important for minimizing false negatives.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both for more comprehensive performance evaluation.
Decision Boundary: The line or surface that separates the classes based on feature values.
3. K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN)
K-Nearest Neighbours is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. Key characteristics include:

Concept: Classifies a data point based on the majority label of its 
ùëò
k nearest neighbors in the feature space.
Distance Metrics: Uses distance measures such as Euclidean, Manhattan, or Minkowski to determine the nearest neighbors.
Value of 
ùëò
k: Choosing 
ùëò
k is important as it affects model performance:
A smaller 
ùëò
k can be sensitive to noise and lead to overfitting.
A larger 
ùëò
k provides smoother decision boundaries but may underfit the data.
Advantages: Simple to understand and implement, no training phase required.
Disadvantages: Computationally intensive for large datasets, requires scaling features for accurate distance measurement.
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Support Vector Machine is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes. Key concepts include:

Hyperplane: A decision boundary that separates data points into classes. In a two-dimensional space, it's a line; in higher dimensions, it becomes a plane or hyperplane.
Support Vectors: The data points closest to the hyperplane that influence its position. These points are critical for defining the optimal boundary.
Kernel Trick: SVMs use kernels to transform data into higher dimensions when data is not linearly separable. Common kernels include:
Linear Kernel: Used for linearly separable data.
Polynomial Kernel: Maps data into polynomial spaces.
Radial Basis Function (RBF): Maps data into an infinite-dimensional space for non-linear separation.
Advantages: Effective for high-dimensional spaces, robust to overfitting when using an appropriate kernel.
Disadvantages: Can be computationally expensive, and choosing the right kernel and parameters requires expertise.
5. Train, Test and Split Procedure
The train-test split procedure is a method used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model by splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets. Key points include:

Purpose: The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.
Typical Split Ratio: Common splits are 70/30 or 80/20 for training and testing, respectively.
Stratified Splitting: Ensures that each class is proportionally represented in both the training and test sets, useful for imbalanced datasets.
Validation Set: Sometimes, a separate validation set is used alongside the training and test sets for tuning hyperparameters, which helps prevent overfitting.
Cross-Validation: An alternative to a single train-test split, where the data is divided into 
ùëò
k folds, and the model is trained and tested 
ùëò
k times, each with a different train-test split. This method provides a more robust evaluation.
